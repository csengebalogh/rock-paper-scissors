# Rock Paper Scissors 

In this project, I tried to create the famous game's browser version. I included tutorials and credits and tried to come up with my own solutions for problems. Might refactor later.

In this version, you play against the computer. Once you pick, the computer picks randomly, then the results is displayed on screen. Have fun!
